    # Let Dev Containers own the workspace mount behavior.
    # If you prefer explicit mounts, see the optional section below.

    # Recommended for devcontainers
    #working_dir: /workspaces/${LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER_BASENAME:-workspace}

    # Optional: keep the container running even if the image has no long-running process
    command: sleep infinity

    # Optional: if you want to mount another local folder e.g. $HOME/data to /data in the container,
    # uncomment the following lines and adjust the paths as needed.
    #volumes:
      # - ${HOME}/data:/data:cached
    volumes:
      - ..:/workspaces/workspace:cached
